    <p>The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was a significant event that led to World War I. He was the heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne. Along with his wife, Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, they were assassinated on June 28, 1914, by a Bosnian Serb student named Gavrilo Princip. This event is considered one of the key triggers that led to the outbreak of the Great War.</p>

    <p>The assassination and its aftermath eventually led to Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against Serbia, which in turn triggered a series of events that led to the start of World War I, four weeks after Franz Ferdinand's death.</p>
